# Codex Development Playbook (Student-Ready)

This folder turns the project's Codex history into a reproducible, end-to-end workflow that students can copy for their own side projects. It focuses on transparency (what happened, why, and with what prompts) and reproducibility (what to do in what order).

## Start here (student quickstart)

1. Copy `agents.template.md` into your repo as `AGENTS.md` and customize it.
2. Copy `implementation-plan.template.md` into `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
3. Use the prompts in `prompt-library.md` to generate your first plan + schema + seed strategy.
4. Follow the phase checklist in `checkpoints.md` to gate progress.
5. Use `case-study-timeline.md` to see how this project evolved end-to-end.

## Files (linked)

- `codex-playbook.md` -- Full playbook with phases, goals, outputs, and guardrails.
- `prompt-library.md` -- Copy-paste prompts organized by phase.
- `checkpoints.md` -- Decision gates and acceptance criteria.
- `case-study-timeline.md` -- Condensed narrative of how this app was built, tied to the timeline.
- `implementation-plan.template.md` -- Template for creating your own incremental plan.
- `agents.template.md` -- Template for Codex operating instructions.

## Transparency notes

- The detailed decision timeline lives in `/Users/viktorgavrielov/Downloads/CodexDecisionTimeline.md` on this machine.
- If you want the timeline in-repo for students, copy it into `docs/codex-playbook/source-timeline.md` and link it from `case-study-timeline.md`.

## Recommended use in class

- **Day 1:** Read the playbook + prompt library; draft a plan.
- **Day 2:** Implement Phase 1-3; mark checkpoints.
- **Day 3:** Implement Phase 4-6; run tests and log outcomes.
- **Day 4:** Review + polish; write a short retrospective with the timeline as evidence.
