# Codex Development Playbook

This folder turns the project's Codex history into a reproducible, end-to-end workflow that students can copy for their own side projects. It focuses on transparency (what happened, why, and with what prompts) and reproducibility (what to do in what order).

## Start here (quickstart)

1. Copy `agents.template.md` into your repo as `AGENTS.md` and customize it.
2. Copy `implementation-plan.template.md` into `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
3. Use the prompts in `prompt-library.md` to generate your first plan + schema + seed strategy.
4. Follow the phase checklist in `checkpoints.md` to gate progress.
5. Use `case-study-timeline.md` to see how this project evolved end-to-end.
